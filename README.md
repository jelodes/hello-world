First program on GitHub

Hello,

My name is Julie.  I am a high school math teacher at Platteview High School.  I am working on teaching computer science classes in the near future.  I am taking a Cybersecurity class at UNO this week.   Have you heard about the Cybersecurity program at the University of Nebraska at Omaha?  You should check it out at http://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/academics/information-assurance.php

Hey, Julie! It's great to see you on GitHub!
